Lights and Media is a social media agency that helps businesses and brands grow their online presence and reach their target audience. The website was built with Next, Node.js, Typescript, CSS, HTML and Tailwind CSS. The Instagram API was implemented for users to see the latest posts on the agency's account as well as Netlify Forms to handle submissions on the contact us form.
